    <p>Plov is a rice pilaf with meat, carrots, onions and spices, tender chunks of meat and fluffy rice with lots of aromatic flavors. Plov is traditionally made with lamb 
        and is cooked in a huge cooking vessel over an open fire. It is common among Central Asia and in particular, Uzbekistan.</p>


    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 lb leg of lamb(boneless), cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>2 heads garlic(whole)</li>
        <li>2 large onions thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 large carrots, cut into thin matchsticks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cumin seeds</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coriander seeds </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1/2 cup barberry(zereshk)</li>
        <li>2 cups boiling water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the basmati rice in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside</li>
        <li>Wash the garlic heads. Cut the top of the heads (¼ inch / 5 mm). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Toast cumin, coriander seeds and peppercorns in a pan for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Grind in a mortar or spice grinder. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan over high heat. Add the lamb, turning occasionally until the lamb is evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the lamb pieces and set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir in onions and cook, until onion is soft and golden, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in carrots and cook, until carrots are tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the lamb and mix.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the mixture of cumin, coriander, peppercorns and add the barberries.</li>
        <li>Add the whole garlic heads, stirring to distribute the ingredients. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Wash and drain the basmati rice in hot water. Pour the rice over the lamb mixture in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the boiling water (or vegetable broth). The rice should be covered with about ½ inch of water. Do not stir.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients as you serve the dish on a platter. Garnish with the garlic heads.</li>
